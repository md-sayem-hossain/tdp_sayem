                    <p>The class on cloud computing had a fantastic start! The students were engaged and eager to learn about this exciting topic. The lecturer did an excellent job introducing the course, explaining what cloud computing is and why it's important. They used simple language and examples that made it easy for everyone to understand, even if they were new to the subject. 

                        In addition, the students had a class task where they worked together to brainstorm ideas about how cloud computing could be applied in different industries. This activity encouraged collaboration and critical thinking among the students, further enhancing their understanding of the subject.
                        
                        The lecturer also talked about the assignments and how they relate to cloud computing, which helped set clear expectations for the class. Overall, it was an informative and engaging session that left everyone excited to learn more about cloud computing!</p>
